# deck-essentials
Backend scripts for installing essential modules to the Steam Deck. My plan is to build an accompanying Decky Loader plugin to compliment this project.

Currently, we install nfs-utils and the OpenVPN plugin needed by NetworkManager so you can get access to your VPNs.

## Install
Download install.desktop with [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiseitai3/deck-essentials/main/installDeckEssentials.desktop) on your Steam Deck, then run it. (Right click and save file.) Do not dowload it as executable.
Go to your downloads directory and double click it.
You will be prompted for your account password before proceeding.
